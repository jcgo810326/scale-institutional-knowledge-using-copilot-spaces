# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This collection of documents provides a comprehensive, lightweight framework for managing cross-functional product development projects from initiation to retrospective.

## Purpose

These documents serve as a guide for teams at OctoAcme to:
- Deliver customer value iteratively and efficiently
- Maintain clear communication with stakeholders
- Manage risks proactively
- Foster continuous improvement through data-driven decisions
- Ensure accountability and psychological safety

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach balances structure with agility, enabling teams to deliver product features iteratively while maintaining clear communication, risk management, and continuous improvement.

### Key Principles

Our approach is built on five core principles:

1. **Customer-First**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all project decisions
2. **Iterative Delivery**: Ship small, testable increments rather than monolithic releases to enable fast feedback loops
3. **Clear Ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead accountable for success
4. **Data-Informed Decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence, metrics, and user feedback
5. **Psychological Safety**: Encourage open feedback, learning from failures, and blameless retrospectives

### Project Lifecycle Phases

Every OctoAcme project follows a structured lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, align stakeholders, define success metrics, and create a project one-pager
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, estimate scope, define dependencies and definition of done
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Run daily standups, manage backlog, track progress with demos and metrics
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production with pre-release checks, rollback plans, and smoke tests
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings, identify improvements, and track action items for future projects

- **As reference material**: Use individual documents as needed during specific project phases. Each document is self-contained and can be consulted independently

- **For role clarity**: Reference [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to understand team member responsibilities and collaboration patterns

- **For specific challenges**: Jump directly to relevant documents:
  - Unclear project scope? → [Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)
  - Need to create a backlog? → [Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)
  - Facing project risks? → [Risks and Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)
  - Planning a release? → [Release and Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)
